# Carrefour UAE Vegetable Price Scraper

This Python script scrapes vegetable prices from the Carrefour UAE website and saves the data in a CSV file for further analysis or use. The script uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests and the `BeautifulSoup` library for parsing the webpage content.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Requests library (`pip install requests`)
- BeautifulSoup library (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)
- Pandas library (`pip install pandas`)

## How to Use

1. Install the required libraries mentioned above, if you haven't already done so.

2. Clone or download the script from this GitHub repository.

3. Run the `carrefour_vegetable_prices.py` file using Python:

   ```
   python carrefour_vegetable_prices.py
   ```

4. The script will make a request to the Carrefour UAE website and scrape the vegetable prices from the provided URL. It will then store the data in a CSV file named `products_Carrefour.csv`.

## Customize the URL

If you want to scrape vegetable prices from a different page on the Carrefour UAE website or from a different website entirely, you can modify the `url` variable in the script to point to the desired page.

## Note

Please be mindful of scraping websites and respect their terms of service. Make sure to include proper user-agent headers to mimic a regular web browser and avoid overloading the website with requests. Additionally, consider adding a delay between requests to avoid unnecessary strain on the website's servers.
